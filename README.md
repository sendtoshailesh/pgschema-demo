## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Problems
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
make status
# or
docker ps | grep pgschema-demo-db

# Test connection
pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432 -U demo

# Reset database if needed
make clean && make setup
```

#### pgschema Installation Issues
```bash
# Verify Go installation
go version  # Should be 1.21+

# Install latest version
go install github.com/pgschema/pgschema@latest

# Check installation
pgschema --version

# Verify PATH includes Go bin directory
echo $PATH | grep $(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

#### Permission Issues
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x demo.sh
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
chmod +x traditional/disaster.sh

# Or use make commands
make demo  # Handles permissions automatically
```

#### Docker Issues
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker info

# Check Docker Compose version
docker-compose --version  # Should be 1.25+

# View PostgreSQL logs
make logs
# or
docker-compose logs postgres
```

## 🌟 Key Takeaways

### Problems with Traditional Migrations
- ❌ **Manual Migration Writing**: Developers write ALTER/CREATE statements for every change
- ❌ **Schema Drift**: Databases diverge from expected state over time
- ❌ **No Visibility**: Can't preview changes before applying
- ❌ **Failed Migrations**: Leave database in broken, inconsistent state
- ❌ **Complex Rollbacks**: Require manual down-migration scripts
- ❌ **Environment Sync**: Difficult to keep dev/staging/prod in sync
- ❌ **Team Coordination**: Migration numbering conflicts and merge issues

### pgschema Advantages
- ✅ **Declarative**: Declare desired state, pgschema figures out how to get there
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth**: Schema file represents complete desired state
- ✅ **Preview Changes**: See exactly what will change before applying
- ✅ **Automatic Dependencies**: pgschema handles object dependencies automatically
- ✅ **Safe Rollbacks**: Transaction-aware with automatic rollback on failure
- ✅ **Multi-Environment**: Same schema file works across all environments
- ✅ **Team Collaboration**: GitOps workflow with clear review process
- ✅ **PostgreSQL Native**: Full support for advanced PostgreSQL features

### Real-World Impact

**Time Savings**
- 70% reduction in schema management time
