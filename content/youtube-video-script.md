## Script with Timing

### [00:00 - 00:30] Hook & Introduction

**[SCREEN: Title slide with pgschema logo]**

**NARRATOR**: "It's 3 AM. Your phone is buzzing. Your e-commerce platform is down because a database migration failed, leaving your PostgreSQL schema in an inconsistent state. Sound familiar?"

**[SCREEN: Error messages, downtime alerts]**

"If you've worked with databases for more than a few months, you've probably experienced this nightmare. But what if I told you there's a way to eliminate database migration scripts entirely?"

**[SCREEN: pgschema logo with tagline]**

"I'm [Name], and today I'm going to show you pgschema - the tool that transforms PostgreSQL schema management from a manual, error-prone process into a reliable, automated workflow."

### [00:30 - 02:30] The Problem with Traditional Migrations

**[SCREEN: Code editor with traditional migration files]**

**NARRATOR**: "Let's start with the problem. Traditional database migrations require you to write imperative scripts for every single change."

**[SCREEN: Show migration files]**
```
migration_001_create_users.sql
migration_002_create_products.sql  
migration_003_create_orders.sql
migration_004_add_reviews.sql
```

"You have to manually track dependencies, hope nothing goes wrong during deployment, and write complex rollback procedures that may not even work."

**[SCREEN: Show broken migration file]**

"Here's what a typical migration disaster looks like. This migration has multiple errors - missing NOT NULL constraints, trying to create an index on a non-existent column, and referencing tables that don't exist yet."

**[SCREEN: Show error messages]**

"When this runs, some statements succeed, others fail, and your database is left in an inconsistent state. Recovery requires manual intervention, downtime, and a lot of stress."

**[SCREEN: Statistics/costs]**

"The real cost? Downtime, developer hours, production incidents, and increasing complexity as your application grows."

### [02:30 - 04:00] Traditional Migration Disaster Demo

**[SCREEN: Terminal with demo environment]**

**NARRATOR**: "Let me show you this in action. I've set up a demo environment with a simple e-commerce database."

**[SCREEN: Run traditional disaster simulation]**

```bash
cd traditional
./disaster.sh
```

**[SCREEN: Show migration files being applied]**

"Watch what happens when we run these traditional migrations. The first three succeed..."

**[SCREEN: Show successful migrations]**

"But the fourth one fails catastrophically."

**[SCREEN: Show error messages and broken state]**

"Now our database is in an inconsistent state. Some tables were created, others weren't. Some indexes exist, others don't. This is exactly the kind of production incident that wakes you up at 3 AM."

**[SCREEN: Show database state]**

"Traditional recovery would require manual investigation, custom rollback scripts, and coordinating across multiple environments. Not fun."

### [04:00 - 07:30] pgschema Solution Demo

**[SCREEN: Clean terminal, pgschema logo]**

**NARRATOR**: "Now let me show you how pgschema solves this problem with a completely different approach."

**[SCREEN: Reset database]**

"First, let's reset our database to a clean state."

```bash
psql -c "DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;"
```

**[SCREEN: Show pgschema workflow]**

"pgschema follows a simple but powerful workflow. Instead of writing migration scripts that describe HOW to change your database, you declare WHAT you want your schema to look like."

**[SCREEN: Show schema file]**

"Here's our complete desired schema state in a single file. Notice how clean and readable this is compared to scattered migration files."

```sql
-- schema.sql - Complete desired state
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (price >= 0),
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
-- ... more tables
```

**[SCREEN: Run pgschema commands]**

"Let's apply our initial schema:"

```bash
pgschema apply --file schemas/v1_initial.sql --auto-approve
```

**[SCREEN: Show successful application]**

"Perfect! Now let's see what we created:"

```bash
pgschema dump
```

**[SCREEN: Show clean schema output]**

"Beautiful, clean output that's actually readable, unlike pg_dump."

**[SCREEN: Edit schema file]**

"Now, let's add a reviews feature. Instead of writing a migration script, I just edit the schema file to include the reviews table."

**[SCREEN: Show planning]**

"Before applying changes, let's see what pgschema will do:"

```bash
pgschema plan --file schemas/v2_with_reviews.sql
```

**[SCREEN: Show detailed plan]**

"Look at this! pgschema automatically figured out exactly what changes are needed. It shows me what tables will be added, what indexes will be created, and even tells me it can run everything in a transaction for safety."

**[SCREEN: Apply changes]**

"Now let's apply the changes:"

```bash
pgschema apply --file schemas/v2_with_reviews.sql
```

**[SCREEN: Show success]**

"Done! No migration scripts, no dependency tracking, no errors. pgschema handled everything automatically."

### [07:30 - 10:00] Advanced PostgreSQL Features

**[SCREEN: Advanced schema file]**

**NARRATOR**: "But pgschema isn't just for basic tables. It supports advanced PostgreSQL features that many ORMs and migration tools don't handle."

**[SCREEN: Show advanced features]**

"Let me show you our advanced schema with custom types, functions, triggers, row-level security, and materialized views."

```sql
-- Custom types
CREATE TYPE order_status AS ENUM ('pending', 'processing', 'shipped', 'delivered');

-- Custom domains with validation
CREATE DOMAIN email_address AS VARCHAR(255) 
    CHECK (VALUE ~* '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$');

-- Functions and triggers
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_timestamp()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Row-level security
ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY user_orders_policy ON orders
    FOR ALL TO app_user
    USING (user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id')::INTEGER);

-- Materialized views
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW product_stats AS
SELECT 
    p.id,
    p.name,
    COUNT(r.id) as review_count,
    AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.product_id
GROUP BY p.id, p.name;
```

**[SCREEN: Apply advanced schema]**

```bash
pgschema plan --file schemas/v3_advanced.sql
pgschema apply --file schemas/v3_advanced.sql --auto-approve
```

**[SCREEN: Test advanced features]**

"Let's test these advanced features:"

```bash
# Test custom types
psql -c "SELECT 'pending'::order_status;"

# Test functions
psql -c "SELECT update_timestamp();"

# Test materialized views
psql -c "SELECT * FROM product_stats LIMIT 3;"
```

**[SCREEN: Show results]**

"Everything works perfectly! pgschema handles all these advanced PostgreSQL features that would be nightmare to manage with traditional migrations."

### [10:00 - 12:00] GitOps Workflow Integration

**[SCREEN: GitHub Actions workflow]**

**NARRATOR**: "But pgschema really shines in production environments with GitOps integration."

**[SCREEN: Show workflow file]**

"Here's a complete GitHub Actions workflow that automatically generates migration plans on pull requests and applies changes after merge."

**[SCREEN: Show PR workflow simulation]**

"Let me simulate this workflow. When a developer creates a PR with schema changes..."

**[SCREEN: Show plan generation]**

"GitHub Actions automatically generates a migration plan and posts it as a comment for the team to review."

**[SCREEN: Show plan comment]**

"The team can see exactly what changes will be made before they're applied. No surprises, no guesswork."

**[SCREEN: Show merge and apply]**

"After the PR is approved and merged, the changes are automatically applied to production with built-in safety checks."

**[SCREEN: Show concurrent change detection]**

"pgschema even detects concurrent changes. If someone else modifies the database between plan generation and application, pgschema prevents conflicts and ensures the exact reviewed changes are applied."

```bash
# Simulate concurrent change
pgschema plan --file schema.sql --output-json plan.json
psql -c "CREATE TABLE concurrent_change (id SERIAL);"
pgschema apply --plan plan.json --auto-approve
# Shows fingerprint mismatch error
```

### [12:00 - 13:30] Multi-Environment & Getting Started

**[SCREEN: Multi-environment deployment]**

**NARRATOR**: "One of pgschema's biggest advantages is multi-environment consistency. The same schema file works across all your environments."

**[SCREEN: Show deployment commands]**

```bash
# Apply to development
pgschema apply --host dev-db --file schema.sql

# Apply to staging
pgschema apply --host staging-db --file schema.sql

# Apply to production  
pgschema apply --host prod-db --file schema.sql
```

"Each environment reaches the same desired state, regardless of where it started. No more environment drift."

**[SCREEN: Getting started]**

"Ready to try pgschema yourself? It's incredibly easy to get started:"

```bash
# Install pgschema
go install github.com/pgschema/pgschema@latest

# Dump your current schema
pgschema dump > schema.sql

# Make changes to schema.sql
