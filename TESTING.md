pgschema plan --file schemas/v3_advanced.sql
pgschema apply --file schemas/v3_advanced.sql --auto-approve

# Validate PostgreSQL features
psql -c "SELECT 'pending'::order_status;"
psql -c "SELECT update_timestamp();"
psql -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product_stats;"
```

**Validation Points:**
- All pgschema commands work correctly
- Advanced PostgreSQL features are supported
- Schema evolution works as expected
- Error handling is appropriate

### Scenario 3: Conference Presentation
```bash
# Test presentation scenarios
./scripts/quick-demo.sh  # 5-minute version

./scripts/feature-showcase.sh  # Deep dive
```

**Validation Points:**
- Timing is appropriate for presentation slots
- Visual output is clear and engaging
- Key messages are communicated effectively
- Technical depth is appropriate for audience

- Plan generation works correctly
- Security checks function properly
- Deployment simulation succeeds

## üêõ Common Issues to Check

### Database Issues
```bash
# Test database recovery
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
sleep 10
pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432 -U demo
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Test script permissions
ls -la *.sh scripts/*.sh traditional/*.sh
# All should be executable (-rwxr-xr-x)
```

### Path Issues
```bash
# Test command availability
command -v docker
command -v docker-compose
command -v go
command -v pgschema
command -v psql
```

### Schema Issues
```bash
# Test schema file syntax
for file in schemas/*.sql examples/*.sql; do
    echo "Checking $file..."
    pgschema plan --file "$file" --output-json /dev/null
done
```

## üìä Performance Testing

### Demo Timing
```bash
# Time the main demo
time ./demo.sh --auto
# Should complete in under 15 minutes

# Time quick demo
time ./scripts/quick-demo.sh
# Should complete in under 7 minutes
```

### Resource Usage
```bash
# Monitor resource usage during demo
docker stats &
./demo.sh --auto
```
